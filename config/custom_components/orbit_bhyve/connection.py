"""Pooled BLE connection layer shared by all device classes.

Owns: AES handshake, keystream cipher, frame I/O, write lock, idle disconnect.
Per-device-class knobs: frame_magic, trailer_const, post_handshake_hook.

Cipher (verified against 257 captured frames + actuated commands):
  AES-128-ECB used as a CTR-style keystream — block = IV(12B) || ctr_LE(4B),
  encrypted, XORed with plaintext.
  IV = init_rx[0:4] || init_tx[4:12].
  TX counter = uint32_LE(init_tx[12:16]); RX counter = init_tx[16:20].
  Frame = [magic][len][ciphertext (len bytes)][trailer u16_LE].
  Trailer = sum(plaintext) + trailer_const + len.
Commands use WRITE_REQ (response=True) for its ATT delivery ack; char 6c72 also
advertises write-without-response, and both modes have been observed to actuate
the HT34A (fw0107), so WRITE_REQ is a safe default across device classes. The
device's higher-level ack is a NOTIFICATION, not an ATT Write Response — the
ESPHome BLE proxy never relays the (absent) write response, so writes wait only
a capped WRITE_ACK_TIMEOUT_SEC and the notification drain is the real ack.
